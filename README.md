### PAGEGRID is a visual page builder for ProcessWire CMS.

PAGEGRID lets you design responsive, visually rich websites without writing a single line of code. It works seamlessly with ProcessWire’s native templates and fields, giving developers full control over the underlying code and structure while designers and editors can build and update layouts visually. 

<!-- * **Developers** retain full control over code, templates, and fields; Visual tools are optional and you can handle layouts entirely via your own CSS or framework.

* **Designers** can visually layout pages and apply styles without writing code.

* **Editors** get an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that’s easy to learn and prevents mistakes. As a developer, you decide what they can move, style, or change using ProcessWire’s native roles and permissions. -->

### Core Concepts

PAGEGRID builds on ProcessWire’s flexibility without adding abstraction.
Everything stays native, and developers maintain full control. 

* **PAGEGRID is a Field:**
  PAGEGRID is a visual field for ProcessWire that lets you build and manage layouts right inside the CMS. You can use it it to design specific sections of a custom-coded site, or as a full site builder that works without any coding. 

* **Everything Is a Page:**
  Every item in PAGEGRID is a ProcessWire page, defined through native templates and fields.
  Your layouts are built with real ProcessWire data — fully queryable, reusable, and compatible with your existing API and templates.

* **Your Markup:**
  Unlike many other site builders, PAGEGRID gives you complete control over your markup and frontend structure. It adapts to your workflow — not the other way around.

* **Control What Clients Can Edit:**
  Clients get an intuitive visual editor that’s easy to learn.
  As a developer, you decide what they can move, style, or change using ProcessWire’s native roles and permissions.
  Give them creative freedom while keeping the structure safe.

* **Your CSS:**
  PAGEGRID works with your existing CSS — no assumptions or frameworks required.
  Write styles in your code editor or bring your own framework.
  Beyond grids, it supports Flexbox, Block, and Inline-block layouts.

* **Nesting:**
  PAGEGRID supports nested blocks — a powerful but optional feature.
  Define which templates can be used as children to create grouped or structured layouts such as sliders, galleries, or repeatable content sections.
