### PAGEGRID is a friendly pagebuilder for ProcessWire CMS.
Design fully responsive websites (or parts of them) without writing any code. Rearrange and resize items in a visual way and quickly edit the content of your website. 

Use and customise our [ready-made blocks](https://processwire.com/modules/page-grid-blocks/), or create your own block templates using ProcessWire's native templates (and fields).

Don't want to give your client all that power? Features can be enabled per permission (dragging, resizing, editing, adding items/pages, parent/child relations, style panel, etc.) so you have complete control of how much freedom you want to give to the editor of your website.
